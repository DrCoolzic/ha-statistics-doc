# Contribution guidelines

Contributing to this project should be as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the documentation
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## Github is used for everything

Github is used to host documentation, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](../../issues)

GitHub issues are used to track public bugs.
Report a bug by [opening a new issue](../../issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## License
